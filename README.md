=============

An EPICS areaDetector plugin to perform pixel calibration based on corner
detection of a square using OpenCV <placeholder> function.

Additional information:

- Documentation.

  This routine finds edges in an image using the <placeholder> algorithm 

  TODO: Edit this
  There are two parameters: "LowThreshold" and "ThresholdRatio".  Use
  the low threshold to adjust the sensitivity.  Canny suggests that
  the threshold ratio be "two or three to one".

- Release notes.
  
  Needless to say, you'll need to install opencv (http://opencv.org).
  This code was built using verion 3.0 of the opencv API.
